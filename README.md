# Unix Timestamp Scripts

A collection of server-side scripts to output the server's current Unix timestamp.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to be able to deploy it to any web server
and have at least one script that is compatible and able to return
the server's Unix timestamp.

## Languages So Far

| Language | Seconds                    | Milliseconds                         |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| VBScript | [seconds.asp](seconds.asp) | [milliseconds.asp](milliseconds.asp) |

## Contributions

Have a simple script that can return a server's Unix timestamp
in a language not shown here?
